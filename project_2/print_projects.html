						<h4>Posters</h4>

						<section>
							<h5>Daleks in London</h5>

							<img src="images/print/Daleks_in_London.jpg" alt="Daleks in London">

							<p>
								Daleks in London was done for the vector imaging class I took 
								winter quarter my sophomore year. I used my own photo of a 
								random street in London and integrated the Doctor, the TARDIS, 
								and four flying Daleks.

							<h5>Not Just Another Code Monkey</h5>

							<img src="images/print/Not_Another_Code_Monkey.jpg" 
								alt="Not Just Another Code Monkey">

							<p>
								This poster was also a vector imaging class project, but 
								really it is an expression of myself. I had to do a project 
								that utilized type in two different ways, so I used code. 
								I would have to say that this poster is the best reuse of 
								code I've ever seen. The background is a bunch of my GUI 
								code from the 
								<a href="coding_projects.html#PDS">Pizza Delivery System</a>.

						<h4>T-Shirt Designs</h4>

						<section>
							<h5>WYSE/ICTM Team Shirt 2009</h5>

							<img src="images/print/WYSE_09f.jpg" alt="Front of WYSE/ICTM team 
								shirt 2009">
							<img src="images/print/WYSE_09b.jpg" alt="Back of WYSE/ICTM team 
								shirt 2009">

							<p>
								This was my first real design project. For a junior in 
								high school with no design experience, it could certianly have 
								been a complete disaster. As it was, it was an improvement over 
								the previous year's design which was the goal. Looking back now 
								after taking a few design courses, I would change the main font 
								to something less abnoxious - but of course no one cared as I was 
								the most artistically inclined person on the team.
							</p>

							<p>
								In explanation: WYSE is Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering, 
								an international program, headquartered at the University of Illinois, offering the annual Academic Challenge competition, a summer camp and other programs. ICTM stands for Illinois Council of Teachers of 
								Mathematics, which host an annual state-wide math competition. My 
								high school sent a team to both competitions every year. I first went 
								as a freshman and fell into a sort of "team leader" position junior 
								year, when I told the coach I'd take care of the t-shirt, because his 
								design was so lame the year before.

						<h4>Promotional Material</h4>

						<section>
							<h5>SSE Brochure</h5>

							<p>
								In August 2012, I created a new brochure for the Society of 
								Software Engineers (SSE) @ RIT. The previous one was five+ 
								years old and was sorely outdated in both information and 
								design, so I took it upon myself as the Head of Public 
								Relations to see to it that we had an updated, modern 
								brochure to promote our organization. I had a lot of fun 
								working on it. I learned a lot, as it was the first 
								brochure I'd done in about 8 years and the first serious 
								one I'd ever done (i.e. not for a grade school project).
							</p>

							<p>
								While it isn't quite finished yet - it's going through an 
								approval process and has a few pending changes - 
								<a href="images/print/SSE_Brochure.pdf">here</a> is 
								a pdf copy of the current state. Please note that this is 
								not currently an official SSE distribution.
