						<h4>Fleet Dispatch Application</h4>

						<p>
							As an intern at Fidelity Investments during summer 2012, I 
							layed the groundwork for a update fleet dispatch system for 
							Boston Coach. I spent the summer learning about the design 
							principles for iOS and Android and researching the different 
							ways the team I was on could approach the project once it 
							really got started. As a part of this effort, I created a 
							variety of flow diagrams and mock-ups for my designs as well 
							as a document that detailed my findings and explained my designs 
							for each device, including iPhone, iPad, and both Android phones 
							and tablets. Sadly, I cannot post those mock-ups here as I do 
							not have copies of them and they are the intellectual property 
							of Fidelity Institutional.

						<h4>Digital Classroom</h4>

						<p>
							This project was for the class Human-Computer Interaction 2: 
							Design of User Interfaces. I was apart of a 3-person team 
							where I acted as the design lead. All of the layouts, icons, 
							etc are my work. My teammates were in charge of coding the 
							prototype and documentation.
						</p>	

						<p>
							Images will follow soon - and hopefully an applet of the 
							prototype as well.

						<h4>JBrick for iOS</h4>

						<p>
							JBrick for iOS is a iPad application that allows the user 
							to program Lego Mindstorms robots using a drag-and-drop 
							editor. Right now the project is in the early design phases, 
							so all we have is a prototype with a text-based UI and some 
							whiteboard drawings. Moving forward I will be doing the graphics 
							for the project. My teammate and I have already worked out the 
							layout and feature set. Check out our repository on  
							<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jbrick-for-ios/" class="link">Google Code</a>.

						<h4>Pizza Delivery System</h4>

						<p>
							More information to come soon!

					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Personal Website</h4>

						<p>
							This is the first iteration of this site, but once I have more 
							iterations, links to the previous versions will be found here, 
							as well as any mock-ups.
