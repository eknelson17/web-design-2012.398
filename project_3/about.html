					<p>
						I am a third year Software Engineer at Rochester Institute of 
						Technology (RIT). I am concentrating in Human-Computer Interation 
						and User Interface Design on the technical end and Communications 
						on the liberal arts side. I love working on front-end projects. 
						Web and mobile development are my main focuses at this point as I 
						know they are the future and they are so versitile in what you can 
						do design-wise. I advertise myself as a Software Engineer with a 
						flare for design, because I have the logical brain of an engineer 
						but a passion for good design and smooth user experiences. I also 
						am constantly working to build the skills of both and engineer and 
						a designer with the goal of being a User Experience Engineer and 
						eventually a manager of a front-end design and development team.
					</p>

					<p>
						Outside of class, I'm deeply involved in the Society of Software 
						Engineers (SSE). This year I am the Head of Public Relations. As 
						a part of that role I talk to companies and alumni about visiting 
						to give talks, making donations, and about how awesome our members 
						are. I also help with all the open houses by talking abou SSE, 
						leading tours, and answering any and all questions sent my way. A 
						new initiative I started this year is the SSE Ambassador program. 
						Before the PR committee was a one-man operation. With the advent of 
						the ambassador program, the PR committee is now an elite team of 
						individuals trained to work with companies and interact with 
						prospective students. The ambassadors are also working to get the 
						alumni committee off the ground and to unify the social media used 
						by SSE.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of my passions has always been making music. I started playing 
						piano at the age of 4 and joined my first choir when I was 9. Now as 
						a college student I play in the clarinet section of the RIT Pep Band. 
						The band plays at all the Men's and Women's home hockey games and 
						any other event we're invited to play. Check out some of our past 
						performances on our YouTube Channel: 
						<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRITPepBand" class="link">TheRITPepBand</a>. 
					</p>

					<p>
						I also love reading. I was raised on books, not tv and video games - 
						shocking for someone in my field, I know. I'll read most anything I 
						can get my hands on but my favorites are Jane Austen's Pride and 
						Prejudice and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Currently, I'm working my 
						way through the <i>A Song of Fire and Ice series (Game of Thrones)</i> 
						for fun and <i>Mythical Man Month</i> and <i>Steve Jobs</i> for 
						professional development.
