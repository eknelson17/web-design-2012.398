		<h1>Web App v. Native Apps</h1>

		<h2>In the mobile world, what’s the difference between a ‘Web App’ and a ‘Native App’? 
			What sort of challenge does situation this present to Web designers?</h2>

		<p>
			A web app is built in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, whereas a native app is built in whatever 
			language the operating system dictates. Web apps are cross-platform. Native apps are 
			platform specific/dependent.
		</p>

		<p>
			The expansion of mobile browsing means web designers now need to structure their sites 
			in such a way that they can support mobile browsers. They also need to rework designs 
			so they display correctly on the wide variety of mobile devices out in the market today.
		</p>

		<p>
			Web apps vs. native apps are a bigger problem for software developers than designers. 
			Designers just need to learn design conventions for the different platforms. Developers 
			have to learn multiple languages to create native apps for every platform, as well as 
			the design conventions for those times that they don't have a designer available to them.
