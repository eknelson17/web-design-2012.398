				<h4>Fleet Dispatch Application</h4>

				<p>
					As an intern at Fidelity Investments during summer 2012, I 
					layed the groundwork for a update fleet dispatch system for 
					Boston Coach. I spent the summer learning about the design 
					principles for iOS and Android and researching the different 
					ways the team I was on could approach the project once it 
					really got started. As a part of this effort, I created a 
					variety of flow diagrams and mock-ups for my designs as well 
					as a document that detailed my findings and explained my designs 
					for each device, including iPhone, iPad, and both Android phones 
					and tablets. Sadly, I cannot post those mock-ups here as I do 
					not have copies of them and they are the intellectual property 
					of Fidelity Institutional.

				<h4>Digital Classroom</h4>

				<p>
					This project was for the class Human-Computer Interaction 2: 
					Design of User Interfaces. I was apart of a 3-person team 
					where I acted as the design lead. All of the layouts, icons, 
					etc are my work. My teammates were in charge of coding the 
					prototype and documentation.
				</p>	

				<p>
					Images will follow soon - and hopefully an applet of the 
					prototype as well.

				<h4>JBrick for iOS</h4>

				<p>
					JBrick for iOS is a iPad application that allows the user 
					to program Lego Mindstorms robots using a drag-and-drop 
					editor. Right now the project is in the early design phases, 
					so all we have is a prototype with a text-based UI and some 
					whiteboard drawings. Moving forward I will be doing the graphics 
					for the project. My teammate and I have already worked out the 
					layout and feature set. Check out our repository on  
					<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jbrick-for-ios/">Google Code</a>.

				<h4>Personal Website</h4>

				<p>
					This is the first iteration of this site, but once I have more 
					iterations, links to the previous versions will be found here, 
					as well as any mock-ups.
