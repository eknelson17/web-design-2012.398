				Technical/programming
					- 361
					- JBrick
					- link to ACE workshops with photos/videos of the robots I designed/worked on
			-->

			<!-- Add screenshots and pngs of past work -->

			<!-- Also include discriptions and links to repos for technical projects -->

			<!-- Include a downloadable compiled version of apps when possible -->

			<p>
				Below are a handful of the techincal projects I've worked on for both 
				school and work. Check out my GitHub and BitBucket profiles to see 
				more of my work.

				<h4>Lego Mindstorms Robotics</h4>

				<p>	
					Near the end of my freshman year I got my first job relating to 
					softwar engineering as a research assistant on Project ACE, a 
					NSF-funded research project to develop robotics workshops to interest 
					children in computing. All development is done in NXC (Not eXactly C) 
					and ROBOTC.
				</p>

				<p>
					I worked on the project for 6 months and had a ball doing it. During 
					that time I built the three robots below as well as a few others. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The catapult was a legacy project, one of the first ones created for 
					Project ACE. I refactored the entire thing to meet our newer code 
					standards and to convert it to using the libraries one of my co-workers 
					wrote. 
				</p>

				<img src="images/coding/guitar.jpg" alt="Lego Guitar">

				<p>
					The guitar was a project I got off of <a href="nxtprograms.com">
					nxtprograms.com</a> and adapted to work for our project. It was 
					origianally written in NXT-G, so I had to convert it to NXC and ROBOTC, 
					which wasn't a simple as it'd seem due to some concurrency tricks I 
					had to employ. I also ended up writing a music note library for 
					ROBOTC. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, the Plinko game was of my own design, and works more 
					or less like the arcade game version.
				</p>

					All these projects and more can be found on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/project-ace/source/browse/">Google Code</a>.
