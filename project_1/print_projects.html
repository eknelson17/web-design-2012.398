				<h4>Posters</h4>

				<section>
					<h5>Daleks in London</h5>

					<img src="images/print/Daleks_in_London.jpg">

					<p>
						Daleks in London was done for the vector imaging class I took 
						winter quarter my sophomore year. I used my own photo of a 
						random street in London and integrated the Doctor, the TARDIS, 
						and four flying Daleks.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h5>Not Just Another Code Monkey</h5>

					<img src="images/print/Not_Another_Code_Monkey.jpg">

					<p>
						This poster was also a vector imaging class project, but 
						really it is an expression of myself. I had to do a project 
						that utilized type in two different ways, so I used code. 
						I would have to say that this poster is the best reuse of 
						code I've ever seen. The background is a bunch of my GUI 
						code from the 
						<a href="coding_projects.html#PDS">Pizza Delivery System</a>.

				<h4>T-Shirt Designs</h4>

				<section>
					<h5>WYSE/ICTM Team Shirt 2009</h5>

					<img src="images/print/WYSE_09f.jpg" alt="Front of WYSE/ICTM team 
						shirt 2009">
					<img src="images/print/WYSE_09b.jpg" alt="Back of WYSE/ICTM team 
						shirt 2009">

					<p>
						This was my first real design project. For a junior in 
						high school with no design experience, it could certianly have 
						been a complete disaster. As it was, it was an improvement over 
						the previous year's design which was the goal. Looking back now 
						after taking a few design courses, I would change the main font 
						to something less abnoxious - but of course no one cared as I was 
						the most artistically inclined person on the team.
					</p>

					<p>
						In explanation: WYSE is Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering, 
						an international program, headquartered at the University of Illinois, offering the annual Academic Challenge competition, a summer camp and other programs. ICTM stands for Illinois Council of Teachers of 
						Mathematics, which host an annual state-wide math competition. My 
						high school sent a team to both competitions every year. I first went 
						as a freshman and fell into a sort of "team leader" position junior 
						year, when I told the coach I'd take care of the t-shirt, because his 
						design was so lame the year before.

				<h4>Promotional Material</h4>

				<section>
					<h5>SSE Brochure</h5>

					<p>
						In August 2012, I created a new brochure for the Society of 
						Software Engineers (SSE) @ RIT. The previous one was five+ 
						years old and was sorely outdated in both information and 
						design, so I took it upon myself as the Head of Public 
						Relations to see to it that we had an updated, modern 
						brochure to promote our organization. I had a lot of fun 
						working on it. I learned a lot, as it was the first 
						brochure I'd done in about 8 years and the first serious 
						one I'd ever done (i.e. not for a grade school project).
					</p>

					<p>
						While it isn't quite finished yet - it's going through an 
						approval process and has a few pending changes - 
						<a href="images/print/SSE_Brochure.pdf">here</a> is 
						a pdf copy of the current state. Please note that this is 
						not currently an official SSE distribution.
