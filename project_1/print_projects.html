					<h5>WYSE/ICTM Team Shirt 2009</h5>

					<p>
						This is the first my first real design project. For a junior in 
						high school with no design experience, it could certianly have 
						been a complete disaster. As it was, it was an improvement over 
						the previous year's design which was the goal. Looking back now 
						after taking a few design courses, I would change the main font 
						to something less abnoxious - but of course no one cared as I was 
						the most artistically inclined person on the team.
					</p>

					<p>
						In explanation: WYSE is Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering, 
						an international program, headquartered at the University of Illinois, offering the annual Academic Challenge competition, a summer camp and other programs. ICTM stands for Illinois Council of Teachers of 
						Mathematics, which host an annual state-wide math competition. My 
						high school sent a team to both competitions every year. I first went 
						as a freshman and fell into a sort of "team leader" position junior 
						year, when I told the coach I'd take care of the t-shirt, because his 
						design was so lame the year before.
